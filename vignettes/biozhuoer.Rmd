`read_fasta()`/`write_fasta()` can read/write FASTA format file into/from named character. If you feel frustrate with DNAbin or other stophisticated class, and find youself using `read/write_line` and `str_extract/replace/...` repeatedly, may be you can consider this package.

`fasta_to_nexus()` transform that named vector to nexus format.
