Some utility functions in bioinformatics
## Overview

Some utility functions in bioinformatics, still in developing, use at your own risks.

The next generation of [**bioinfor**](https://github.com/dongzhuoer/bioinfor)


`read_fasta()`/`write_fasta()` can read/write FASTA format file into/from named character. If you feel frustrate with DNAbin or other stophisticated class, and find youself using `read/write_line` and `str_extract/replace/...` repeatedly, may be you can consider this package.

`fasta_to_nexus()` transform that named vector to nexus format.

## to do

add more test for read-fasta (unalign)
